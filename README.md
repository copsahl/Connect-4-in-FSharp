# Connect-4-in-FSharp
A very basic, buggy, game of connect four. Written in F#.

This is my first program ever written in F#.

I know the code is held together with super glue and duct tape, but I am proud I made this.

This was an for extra credit in my CSC 150, so I basically learned the basics of F# and then attempted to write a game. It kinda worked out.

Anyways, if you guys have some constructive critisism that would be great. 

:D
